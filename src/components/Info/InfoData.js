By pushing the nose of the surfboard underwater, and letting the body follow, you are able to get under the breaking wave and ditch being “washed” in the wave. With a bit of practice and a surfboard that is small in volume, you will master a duck dive and experience that the paddle out to the lineup feels easier.",
