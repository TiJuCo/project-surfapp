                "“We have been tracking this weather system for a few days and conditions seem to keep improving with very large swell and light winds,” Bill Sharp, Big Wave Tour General Manager said. “This looks to be the best opportunity in the season so we have decided to call the Green Alert.”",
                "“There has been so much progression in tow-surfing these last few years that it is great to finally have a format that really suits it,” Sharp added. “Everybody will surf several times and at the end of the day will get together to decide the winners, this is really exciting!”",
                "It will be he first, team-oriented big wave tow-in event in the league’s history.",
                "Here’s how it works:",
                "– 19 big wave surfers from around the globe – 17 men and 2 women – will be paired up in tow teams;",
                "–  They will compete in a four-hour expression session with no elimination, and an option to run longer if conditions are right;",
                "–  The session will feature a rotating heat format and priority system that keeps five teams in the water at all times;",
                " – Each tow team will get two, one-hour heats to whip each other into waves of mind-boggling heights;",
                
                "Guinness World Records will potentially be broken, severe wipeouts and daring feats of water rescue. And, unique to this event, the final results will be determined by an athlete-led judging panel."

                "The waves are fun on all seasons of the year in Portugal, but Autumn is probably the best time to be around. The big swells get more common, the winds are often off shore and the cold of Winter has yet to arrive.",
                "Recently Carcavelos had one of those tipycal Autumn swells and the world class spot produced some amazing waves."

            "The Caparica Surf Fest powered by Oakley concluded a fourth consecutive day of action in solid conditions that challenged most of the surfers today. The men’s QS3,000 finished the remaining heats of Round 4 and the Junior divisions advanced through three rounds to set up for the finals tomorrow.",
            "In the main event, the men’s QS3,000 division, pressure was at an all-time high as the remaining battles of Round 4, the event’s top seeded round, unfolded in tricky conditions again. With the forecast looking much better for the last two days of competition, it’s make-or-break in Round 4 and surfers fought in the unruly surf for a chance to surf good waves in the events final rounds.",
            "Vicente Romero (ESP) was the first surfer to really figure out the moving lineup and capitalize on a smart approach to positioning and riding the right waves.",
            "“It was hard work out there,” Romero said. “With the incoming tide I knew there was going to be that left in the current, but everyone paddled out the back and I really tried to stay on that inside. My strategy worked well so I’m stoked to make it through like this.”",
            "Alonso Correa (PER) scored the round’s highest single number of 8.00 in the following heat and former Championship Tour athlete Nat Young (USA) took a commanding win in Heat 12. But once again it was Noah Hill (HAW), the surfer from Maui who posted a near-perfect heat in the juniors yesterday (19.67 out of a possible 20), who showed the most confidence as he built a healthy total of 14.37 to take the win into Round 5.",
            "“It feels really good to make heats and get scores considering I’m just coming off an injury.” he said.",
            "The next two heats were taken out by Frenchmen Maxime Huscenot (FRA) and Charly Martin (FRA). Miguel Blanco (PRT) and Frederico Morais (PRT) advanced as well and will join Vasco Ribeiro (PRT) in Round 5 to defend the Portuguese colors in Caparica."

            "The Caparica Surf Fest powered by Oakley launched today in building surf and strong onshore winds to complete an astonishing 56 heats on two separate banks, covering men’s QS and Junior action as well as women’s QS.",
            "The surf almost doubled in size between the morning heats that unfolded in grey weather with a slight drizzle and the afternoon pumping action when the sun came out and crowds gathered to watch the battles from the beach.",
            "If you have been following events of the past week in Portugal, none of the names in question today will surprise you. In the men QS3,000’s second round, the recent quarterfinalist in Santa Cruz Thomas Debierre (FRA) picked up right where he left off with powerful, dominant surfing in the overhead surf.",
            "The talented 18 year-old surfer from Guadeloupe posted an impressive 15.57 heat total to advance in first out of Round 2. Starting right from the opening round, Debierre will once again have a long road ahead if he wants to reach the finals of this event, which he has won as a Junior back in 2016.",
            "“I had a good rest over the weekend and came back fired up today for some more,” Debierre stated. “I’ve surfed a few times here in the past and really appreciate it, it’s a powerful, long open wall so that really fits with my surfing. I’ve had some successes in the past here, I won once and got a third last year so I’m hoping for more. I’ve had a pretty terrible season last year, plagued by injuries but now I feel good physically and I’m happy to be making heats.”",       
            "Yesterday, the Junior Pro Espinho culminated with an impressive performance from Justin Becret (FRA), who unsurprisingly, given the opportunity to do battle with older competitors, came out firing today in the opening rounds of the QS. Becret belted his own two high-7s to take the win into Round 3, and will juggle back-and-forth between the junior and QS events in Caparica in the coming days."
