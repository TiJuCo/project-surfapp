                "The World Surf League (WSL) Big Wave Tour (BWT) has issued a Green Alert for the Nazaré Tow Surfing Challenge pres. By Jogos Santa Casa at Nazaré, Portugal to run on tomorrow, February 11, 2020. The first call will be made at 8 a.m. local time (GMT) on Tuesday.",
                "“We have been tracking this weather system for a few days and conditions seem to keep improving with very large swell and light winds,” Bill Sharp, Big Wave Tour General Manager said. “This looks to be the best opportunity in the season so we have decided to call the Green Alert.”",
                "“There has been so much progression in tow-surfing these last few years that it is great to finally have a format that really suits it,” Sharp added. “Everybody will surf several times and at the end of the day will get together to decide the winners, this is really exciting!”",
                "It will be he first, team-oriented big wave tow-in event in the league’s history.",
                "Here’s how it works:",
                "– 19 big wave surfers from around the globe – 17 men and 2 women – will be paired up in tow teams;",
                "–  They will compete in a four-hour expression session with no elimination, and an option to run longer if conditions are right;",
                "–  The session will feature a rotating heat format and priority system that keeps five teams in the water at all times;",
                " – Each tow team will get two, one-hour heats to whip each other into waves of mind-boggling heights;",
                
                "Guinness World Records will potentially be broken, severe wipeouts and daring feats of water rescue. And, unique to this event, the final results will be determined by an athlete-led judging panel."

                "Contest officials were right. Saturday started off slow at Praia de Carcavelos, but waves at the barreling beach break built up to photo-worthy conditions down the stretch of the 2022 Perfect Chapter.",
                "The event is intended to run on the best day of the winter with competitors strictly focused on riding barrels, and while Saturday’s size at Carcavelos may have underwhelmed at first, there was no shortage of spitting tubes throughout the day. Those in the know expected the slow start but predicted a bump in size with the tide push. They got just that, and it came with strong offshore winds that never turned. By the end of the third round and throughout most of the semifinal heats, the shallow beach break was legitimately pumping.",
                "Aside from predicting otherwise unpredictable wave conditions, event organizers also expected a solid turnout of Cascais’ local spectators. A single-day event, Perfect Chapter had never run on a weekend until getting the green light earlier this week. Sure enough, the boardwalk was filled with beachgoers, beachside cafes were filled with patrons taking in the contest, and the sand itself was littered with fans throughout the day. Howling offshore winds be damned.",
                "They saw Maui’s Clay Marzo surf two of his three heats in trunks while the rest of the field (and every weekend warrior surfing outside of the buoys) was decked out in 4/3 full suits and the entire beach huddled in hooded jackets. Marzo cracked a joke at dinner Friday night about wearing boardshorts — at least it seemed like a joke at the time. But sure enough, he surfed his morning heat in a full suit before deciding he’d prefer the full range of motion over the warmth of a tiny bit of neoprene.",
                "Spectators also saw that 44-year old Cory Lopez clearly still has it. Lopez advanced through the entire day and put up some of the contest’s best scores well into the four-man final. In the end, he came up just one wave short, posting a 10.25  in a final heat in which he, Pedro Boonman, Kiran Jabour, and Aritz Aranburu were scrambling around the beach looking for barrels. When it was all said and done, it was Aranburu who stood on top. The Spaniard won Perfect Chapter for the second time along with the Go Chill Best Score award and the 58 Surf Best Tube award, leaving Portugal with an electric bike, a check, and a trophy board for his efforts.",
                "“It’s very special to surf here in Carcavelos, with the support of the public so close,” he said after his win. “The level (of surfing) was incredible, with great barrels. I’m happy to win the championship with perfect waves and surfers of such a good level.”"

                "Event No. 9 and 10 on the Women’s and Men’s Championship Tour respectively, the MEO Rip Curl Pro Portugal has already witnessed epic performances from some of the world’s best surfers and will likely resume tomorrow, October 20.",
                "“There’s really strong onshore winds already this morning and the swell has dropped,” Jessi Miley-Dyer, VP Tours and Competition said. “We’re not going to be On today but it looks good for tomorrow with really clean offshore winds and smaller waves.",
                "When competition resumes, the remaining 16 surfers in both the men and women fields will battle it out at Supertubos for a spot in the Quarterfinals. The World Title race is alive and well with all male and female contenders still in the hunt in Portugal.",

                "The MEO Rip Curl Pro Portugal has already played host to a number of amazing stories with the provisional qualifications of Kolohe Andino and Jeremy Flores for the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games, and could bring the good news to a few more surfers as competition continues to unfold in the coming days.",

The men’s QS3,000 finished the remaining heats of Round 4 and the Junior divisions advanced through three rounds to set up for the finals tomorrow.",
            "In the main event, the men’s QS3,000 division, pressure was at an all-time high as the remaining battles of Round 4, the event’s top seeded round, unfolded in tricky conditions again. With the forecast looking much better for the last two days of competition, it’s make-or-break in Round 4 and surfers fought in the unruly surf for a chance to surf good waves in the events final rounds.",
            "Vicente Romero (ESP) was the first surfer to really figure out the moving lineup and capitalize on a smart approach to positioning and riding the right waves.",
            "“It was hard work out there,” Romero said. “With the incoming tide I knew there was going to be that left in the current, but everyone paddled out the back and I really tried to stay on that inside. My strategy worked well so I’m stoked to make it through like this.”",
            "Alonso Correa (PER) scored the round’s highest single number of 8.00 in the following heat and former Championship Tour athlete Nat Young (USA) took a commanding win in Heat 12. But once again it was Noah Hill (HAW), the surfer from Maui who posted a near-perfect heat in the juniors yesterday (19.67 out of a possible 20), who showed the most confidence as he built a healthy total of 14.37 to take the win into Round 5.",
            "“It feels really good to make heats and get scores considering I’m just coming off an injury.” he said.",
            "The next two heats were taken out by Frenchmen Maxime Huscenot (FRA) and Charly Martin (FRA). Miguel Blanco (PRT) and Frederico Morais (PRT) advanced as well and will join Vasco Ribeiro (PRT) in Round 5 to defend the Portuguese colors in Caparica."

            "The surf almost doubled in size between the morning heats that unfolded in grey weather with a slight drizzle and the afternoon pumping action when the sun came out and crowds gathered to watch the battles from the beach.",
            "If you have been following events of the past week in Portugal, none of the names in question today will surprise you. In the men QS3,000’s second round, the recent quarterfinalist in Santa Cruz Thomas Debierre (FRA) picked up right where he left off with powerful, dominant surfing in the overhead surf.",
            "The talented 18 year-old surfer from Guadeloupe posted an impressive 15.57 heat total to advance in first out of Round 2. Starting right from the opening round, Debierre will once again have a long road ahead if he wants to reach the finals of this event, which he has won as a Junior back in 2016.",
            "“I had a good rest over the weekend and came back fired up today for some more,” Debierre stated. “I’ve surfed a few times here in the past and really appreciate it, it’s a powerful, long open wall so that really fits with my surfing. I’ve had some successes in the past here, I won once and got a third last year so I’m hoping for more. I’ve had a pretty terrible season last year, plagued by injuries but now I feel good physically and I’m happy to be making heats.”",       
            "Yesterday, the Junior Pro Espinho culminated with an impressive performance from Justin Becret (FRA), who unsurprisingly, given the opportunity to do battle with older competitors, came out firing today in the opening rounds of the QS. Becret belted his own two high-7s to take the win into Round 3, and will juggle back-and-forth between the junior and QS events in Caparica in the coming days."
