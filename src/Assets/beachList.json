As being an extremely consistent wave that is suitable for various levels of surfing, Ribeira d’Ilhas is crowded most of the time. However, on an average day, there are several peaks with plenty of waves to spread the crowds. The inside is shorter but steeper and can be a fun option when the main peak is too crowded. And the break in front of Pedra Preta (black rock) just north of the main peak is also a good alternative.

The warm red and ochre hues of the cliffs dominate to the north; and to the south, the grey of the craggy schist rocks once again comes to the fore. Amado Beach is famed for its versatile, diversified waves that justify the constant presence of on-site surfing schools. It is a frequent venue for national and international competitions in the sport. Despite being a very popular beach, you can still find some peaceful spots if you walk along the sands for a bit. A network of walkways leads visitors to various parts of the beach and to viewpoints overlooking it. There is road access via the cliff to the north, allowing you to reach Bordeira Beach, passing by the place known as Pontal and the curious fishing harbour at Zimbreirinha, where the boats are moored on wooden platforms suspended on the cliff. Along the route, there are various stopping points from which you can admire the stunning scenery along this stretch of coast.",

With more swell and the right swell direction, this righthander can connect all the way to the inside with a section called ‘Esquerda da Rocha’ (the rock’s left). The shore break can be quite heavy with a rising tide, so take care with getting in and out of the water. There is also another surf break called Bafureira on the other side of the bay. Please note that the best time to surf this stretch of coast is October to March. In the summer there are usually no waves!",

Normally the best time to surf is below mid tide, but this can change easily when the sand banks move. On the smaller days São Julião is beginner friendly and then you’ll also find multiple surf schools here. On the bigger days, the rips are heavy and dangerous. The main peak at the parking might be crowded, but as you walk along the beach towards Praia da Vigia you can have waves for yourself.

The beach at Tonel is a generous sweep of golden sand backed by steep cliffs that vary from soft, red sandstone to the hard, sheer rock of the headland. But this is the beginning of the Algarve's west coast and is a far cry from the resort beaches further east. Praia do Tonel has a wild rugged feel to it, as it should being located on what was once thought of as the edge of the World. In the summer the waves tend to be a little smaller and there is a lifeguard patrol on the beach. Whilst this definitely makes things safer Tonel still isn't ideal for families with young children. The sea can be quite unpredictable here and it is renown for having strong currents. Just offshore is a small islet known as the Lion rock - at a squint, from the right angle it does look a little like a lion! It is quite common to see anglers sat on top of the rock, even when the tide is in and the surf is up - it is something of a mystery how they get out there (and back!).",

Set in a south-facing bay Mareta benefits from the sunshine all day whilst being much more sheltered from the waves than the neighbouring Atlantic coast beaches. For this reason the beach here is used for a variety of watersports from kayaking and windsurfing to diving. The sea here isn't always flat calm though and Praia da Mareta is not only a great spot to learn to surf but can be the only place sheltered enough to surf in the winter months. There is a choice of three restaurants along the beach here all offering the usual range of light snacks up to full, sit-down meals. Other facilities include a seasonal lifeguard service, toilets and relatively close parking. ",
